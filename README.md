Mario-Clone
===========

Mario Clone made in libgdx

The genre is an Arcade 2D Platformer. Similiar to the classic Mario Bros games, it is a parallax sidescroller with the camera moving with the player. The player is also able to interact(kill or get killed) by enemies that are controlled by AI. There are also different items that effect the player differently. To win the player must reach the end of the map without dying. There is also a scorekeeper to keep track of information on how many powerups and coins you collected. The game can be further altered with this information.
